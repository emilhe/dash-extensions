### Added

- Added tests for the main parts of the code
- Added LGTM analysis for the main parts of the code
- Added a new, interactive documentation page

- Added `escape` functionality to `PrefixIdTransform`, default to escape ids starting with "a-" (used for anchors)

### Removed

- The `multipage` module. Please use the `pages` plugin instead (available in [dash-labs](https://github.com/plotly/dash-labs))

- The `Monitor` component. Now that Dash has introduced (limited) support for circular callbacks, it has become irrelevant
